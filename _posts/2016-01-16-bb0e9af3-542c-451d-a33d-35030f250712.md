**listening for stillness**

I want to hold the hand of my attention like we were fifth graders,
  
like these words were a playground & the whistles of teachers &
  
far away car crashes were never so loud as to upset the rhythm of our swinging
  
I want to ignore the ringing bells & fall into the kind of prolonged silence
that settles birds onto tree branches, that launches a thousand ships of thought,
  
that ought not be such a stranger to me 

stillness is a foreign language & I find myself lamenting
  
the fact I am no longer fluent, despite having grown up
  
with it rolling from my tongue like waterfalls 

they say the best way to learn a language is immersion,
  
so I wander to the places it is still spoken in whispers &
  
wonder if I will ever find real comfort there, because 

listening for stillness can feel like hailing a cab at two in the morning,  
after the bars flood the streets with an intoxicated parade of noise,
  
of girls & boys that scream, that vibrate, that ring, &
  
the electrical grid of my mind short circuits like a wild circus
  
when all I want is the calm of the meter ticking predictably home,  
emptying my pockets of everything that isn't a part of me
